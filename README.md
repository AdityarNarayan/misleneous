Request for Python Installation on VDI
Purpose
I can see scope of develop and deploy automation tools. These tools will streamline various operational tasks, enhance analyst productivity, and reduce human errors in repetitive processes.
Use Cases
1. Alert Closure Automation
Develop a web automation tool to facilitate the closure of alerts on web platforms. This will significantly reduce the time required for alert management and eliminate potential human errors during the process.
2. Counterparty Screening
Automate the process of conducting Google searches for counterparties to identify any negative news. The tool will save relevant webpages as PDFs for future reference, ensuring thorough and consistent screening.
Note:- More use case can come based on the business requirement.
Software Requirements
The following software and libraries are required for the development and execution of the automation tools:
Python Environment
• Python version: 3.10.4 or above
IDE
• Visual Studio Code (version 1.102 or above)
Operating System
• Windows 11
Required Python Libraries
We need certain libraries to be installed. We can consider below options:
Option 1: If pip installation work on VDI I can install libraries on my own.
